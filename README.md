## Project Summary

In this project, I have applied the skills that I have acquired throughout the programme and demostrated them by building it. 

I used the ["Hello World" app](https://github.com/shubhks21/project-ml-microservice-kubernetes/tree/feature/circleci/Lesson-3-Containerization/python-helloworld) as a reference for this project.

### Project Objectives Achieved

* Tested the code using linting
* Completeted a Dockerfile to containerize this application
* Deployed a containerized application using Docker
* Created Amazon EKS cluster and configured it
* Deployed a sample Python "Hello World" app to the kubernetes cluster using blue-green and rolling deployment strategies.
* Uploaded a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that my code has been tested
